object oriented idea: combining related data and logic/behavior to make a class/object
static does not require an object instance. One copy of that thing for the whole program.
non-static/instance exist on one particular object at a time.
A class serves as a template to create an object.
Class members are private by default. Only the class can see them. We can change them to public instead.

DRY principle: don't repeat yourself
